The markdown files in the doc root are automatically added as documentation
pages (in priority modified alphabetical order).

The markdown snippets in this directory are used as introductions for the "chapters" and are not
read automatically.

They're manually read and fed as `intros` props to the ExpressionDocs components in 
build-docs.js
